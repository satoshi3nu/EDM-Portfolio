* Which Company Size pays the Highest(Complete the dashboard as shown below)
* Which Sector Employs the Lowest and Highest Data Science related Jobs
* Which Sector has the Minimum Average Salary and Maximum average Salary

* D. Sector Employs the Lowest and Highest Data Science related Jobs
  - Sector - Count - Avg Min Sal - Avg Max Sal
* E. Sector has the Minimum Average Salary and Maximum average Salary
  - Sector - Average Salary
*  Do the same process create a slicer, used the shape, pivotchart and formula to create a output
